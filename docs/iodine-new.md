## Short Intro
Iodine is a lightweight, open-source DNS tunneling tool that uses DNS queries to transmit data between devices. It works by exploiting the fact that DNS queries can be used to send small amounts of data over the internet without being detected.

## symptoms

DNS lookups are possible via "dig" or "nslookup" but other types of network protocols are restricted

!!! warning "Security Considerations:"

    While Iodine provides a level of security, it's essential to consider the following: 
    - Encryption : Although Iodine encrypts data packets, it's not ideal for sensitive or high-priority information.
    - Server compromise : If an attacker gains access to the Iodine server, they can potentially intercept and decode encrypted data packets.

## Security and testing (about security audits and any usabilty testing)

# How to USE
Here's a simplified overview of how Iodine works: 
- The user creates an account on a Iodine server.
- The user generates a public key and shares it with the server.
- The user uses their device to send DNS queries to the Iodine server, which are then transmitted as encrypted data packets.
- The Iodine server receives these packets and forwards them back to the original sender.
